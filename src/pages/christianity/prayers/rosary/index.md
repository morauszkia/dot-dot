# The Rosary

The Rosary is a simple Scripture-based contemplative prayer focusing on the events of the life of Jesus. There are four sets of mysteries, five in each set, focusing on various periods of Christ's life:

- the [Joyful mysteries](./joyful) focus on the birth and childhood of Christ
- the [Luminous mysteries](./luminous) on the public ministry
- the [Sorrowful mysteries](./sorrowful) on his Passion and death
- the [Glorious mysteries](./glorious) on his Resurrection, Ascension, the sending of the Holy Spirit, and Mary's assumption and coronation as queen of Heaven

## The structure of the rosary

While there may be variations, the basic structure is the following:

The Rosary begins with the [Apostles' Creed](../creed#the-apostles-creed), followed by the [Our Father](../our-father), three [Hail Mary](../hail-mary)-s and a [Glory be](../other-prayers#glory-be). These are the introductory prayers.

These are followed by five decades consisting of an Our Father, ten Hail Mary-s, a Glory Be, and (optionally) finished with the [Fatima Prayer](../other-prayers#the-fatima-prayer).

After the five decades, the [Hail Holy Queen](../other-prayers#the-hail-holy-queen) is prayed, or other prayers for the intercession of Mary. For example, in Hungary the [Sub tuum presidium](../other-prayers#sub-tuum-praesidium) and another prayer for the intercession of Mary is prayed.
