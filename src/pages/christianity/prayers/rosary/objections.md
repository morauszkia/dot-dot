# Objections to the Rosary

Based on: [Shameless Popery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc-uFyfpGG4)

## Not in Scripture

True, Rosary itself is not found in Scripture in its complete form, however, not being in the Bible does not imply that something is forbidden. The rule "You only may do things found in the Bible" itself is not found in the Bible.

## Too Repetitive

Mt 6:7 warns about _vain repetitions_. However, this is not against praying form prayers, as in the very next verse Jesus teaches the _Our Father_. Jesus himself, in the Garden of Gethsemane prays the same prayer three times in a row (Mt 26). Paul also describes himself repeating the same prayer request three times ("Three times I besought the Lord about this..."). Jesus warns about _mindless_ repetition or recitation of a prayer, as if it was some kind of incantation. Rosary is a contemplative prayer if done properly.

## Too much focus on Mary

This argument is twofold. On the one hand, one might argue about asking Mary's intercession. While intercession of Saints is a huge topic in itself, the opposition to it is either because Saints are considered dead, or because "there should be no other mediator between men and God than Jesus Christ."

However, the Saints are not dead, but alive in God. See for instance, what Jesus had to say to the Sadducees about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or the relevant passages about Saint interceding in the Book of Revelations.

Also, the passage from Saint Paul in _1Tim 2:5_ is in fact about intercession. Paul does not condemn, in fact, he urges us to intercede for each other. Protestans themselves often ask others to intercede on their behalf. There is nothing wrong with that. Furthermore, as James tells us, the prayers of a righteous person have great power.

It is true, that the Hail Mary is the most common prayer of the Rosary. If we consider asking the Virgin Mary for intercession ok, then we shouldn't be anxious over favoring one good thing over another, as we do that always. However, some might consider the Hail Mary idolatrous. But, the first part of the Hail Mary comes directly from Scripture: these are the words of the angel Gabriel and of Elisabeth. The second part is a simple asking for intercession.

Some might feel uncomfortable calling Mary holy, but people are called holy all the time in Scripture. As to the "mother of God" part, this simply acknowledges, that Mary is the mother of Jesus, who is God.

## Too physical

The usage of beads should not be considered problematic, as these are simply used to help us keep track of where we are. These are not themselves the object of our worship. Jesus himself worked through physical things in Scripture. Physical things are not evil, and can be used to aid worship.
