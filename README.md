UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is a simple web page, where I will keep my notes on various subjects.
This will only be a static site for now, I just wanted a place where I can store and browse my notes easily. I also wanted to be able to write my notes using Markdown, and view them as html web pages.

I also wanted to try Astro.

I have a separate [repo](https://github.com/morauszkia/coding-notes) for my [Coding Notes webpage](https://morauszkia.github.io/coding-notes/), also under construction. That one is being built using VitePress.

## Built with

- Astro
- Markdown for the text-heavy content
- Vue (coming soon) for UI components

## Table of Contents

- Christian Notes: Bible, Rosary, Prayer
- Books
- Fitness & Health
- Wellness & Happyness
